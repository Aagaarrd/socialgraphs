# Introduction

Our project is based on an analysis of the Cartoon Network animated TV-series Adventure Time. The series concluded in September of 2018 with 10 seasons and 283 episodes. We wish to present some questions and hypotheses and try to answer them with network and text analysis.
# Network analysis
We gather a list of characters for each episode from the [Adventure Time Wiki](adventuretime.fandom.com). This already leads us to some fairly important choices since the network has multiple ways of being modelled. We've chosen to make a list of combinations of all the characters in each episode, since the way the data is potrayed gives a good indication of which characters are the most important.

This results in a network with 968 nodes and 18714 edges.
